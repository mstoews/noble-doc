# Making the Case for Digital Payments

*A practical guide for condo boards and not-for-profits*

If your board is still collecting condo fees or processing reimbursements by cheque or cash, you’re not alone — but you **are** taking unnecessary risks.

Paper cheques and cash may feel familiar, but they’re not safe or efficient. Digital payments, especially when managed through secure platforms like **Plaid**, are far more secure, transparent, and easier to manage. This article will help you understand why switching is better for your organization *and* your members — and how to bring everyone on board, even those who are hesitant about technology.

## The Risk No One Talks About: Cheques and Cash Are Easy to Steal or Lose

Let’s start with the facts:

- In 2023, **65% of organizations experienced cheque fraud** — the highest of any payment method.
- Banks in North America are flagging **hundreds of thousands of cheque fraud cases** per year.
- **Cash?** It’s untraceable. If it’s stolen or misplaced, it’s gone — and there’s no audit trail.

These methods are magnets for both internal mishandling and external theft. And with today’s rise in mail fraud, a cheque dropped in a mailbox isn’t nearly as safe as it once was.

## Why EFTs and Platforms Like Plaid Are Safer

**Electronic Funds Transfers (EFTs)** have been around for decades and are widely used by governments, employers, and financial institutions. But when paired with a secure platform like **Plaid**, they become even safer.

Plaid connects your bank to approved financial software — **without ever exposing your login credentials**. It uses:

- ✅ **Bank-level encryption**
- ✅ **Tokenized connections** (your data is never shared with third parties)
- ✅ **Read-only access** (no one can touch your money without authorization)
- ✅ **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)**

This is like upgrading from a lockbox to a bank vault with security cameras and ID checks.

## Dual Approval: Even Safer Than a Two-Signature Cheque

Your old process may have required two board members to sign each cheque. That’s a good practice — but it’s manual, slow, and still vulnerable.

With a digital system like **Noble Ledger**, dual approvals can be enforced **digitally**:

- One person initiates the payment.  
- A second person reviews and approves it.  
- MFA ensures both people are who they say they are.

No one person can act alone, and every step is logged. It’s more secure, more auditable, and far less hassle than tracking down paper signatures.

## Reassuring Your Members: “But I Don’t Trust Online Payments…”

This is a common concern. Many members, especially seniors, may not trust new technology — or may simply not understand how it works. Here’s how to help:

- ✅ **Start with the “why”**: Emphasize the safety and traceability. *“If there’s ever a question about where your money went, we’ll have a record — down to the minute.”*
- ✅ **Use analogies**: Explain that cheques are like sending money in an envelope through the mail, while EFTs are like wiring money securely through a bank.
- ✅ **Offer support**: Let members know they can ask for help setting it up. Some may prefer to use their bank’s pre-authorized payment form rather than a digital app — that’s fine too.
- ✅ **Give options, but set a direction**: You don’t have to cut off cheques overnight. But let members know the organization is moving toward digital payments for everyone’s safety and efficiency.
