***Setting up appropriate accounting policies for a condo corporation***

*Introduction*

For Canadian non-profits (NPOs) and condominium boards, financial oversight is crucial. Yet, many `organizations` still rely on **outdated, manual payment approval methods**—primarily cheques that require dual signatures. While this traditional approach was once a gold standard for financial control, it has become increasingly inefficient, costly, and vulnerable to fraud.

**Noble Ledger Inc.**, utilizing **Plaid’s API**, is revolutionizing payment approvals by providing a **secure, digital, and real-time** alternative that maintains the necessary oversight while vastly improving efficiency. This article explores the core problems with traditional cheque-based payment approvals and why a digital transformation is overdue.

### The Challenges of Traditional Payment Approvals

### **1. Slow and Inefficient Processing**

-   **Delays in obtaining signatures**: Coordinating two signatories for every cheque can take days or even weeks if board members are unavailable.
-   **Physical presence required**: Signers often need to be in the same location, requiring in-person meetings, couriers, or mailing cheques.
-   **Time wasted on administrative work**: Preparing, printing, signing, and mailing cheques adds unnecessary workload for staff and board members.

### **2. High Operational Costs**

-   **Cheque fees**: Banks charge for issuing, processing, and reconciling cheques.
-   **Courier/mailing expenses**: When signatories are not available, courier services or express mail add extra costs.
-   **Lost time**: Delays in cheque approvals lead to late payments, resulting in potential **penalties or strained vendor relationships**.

### **3. Security & Fraud Risks**

-   **Forgery & alterations**: Cheques can be **altered, forged, or stolen**, leading to unauthorized transactions.
-   **Lack of real-time oversight**: Boards typically approve payments after they’ve already been issued, increasing the risk of undetected fraud.
-   **Duplicate payments**: Human error can lead to duplicated transactions, causing unnecessary financial losses.
-   **Vulnerability to embezzlement**: If internal controls fail, rogue employees or board members can exploit gaps in cheque approvals.

### Why NPOs & Condo Boards Need a Change

With the increasing availability of secure financial technology, **organizations no longer need to rely on slow, outdated cheque-based approval methods**. Canadian NPOs and condo boards must **embrace modern digital solutions** to:

-   **Speed up approvals** by enabling remote dual approvals through secure online platforms.
-   **Reduce costs** by eliminating cheque-related expenses and manual processing.
-   **Enhance security** through encryption, audit trails, and automated fraud detection.
-   **Ensure transparency** with real-time tracking and digital documentation of every payment.
