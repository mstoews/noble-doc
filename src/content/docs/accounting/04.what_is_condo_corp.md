Condominium living is a popular choice for many people across Saskatchewan â€” and at the heart of every condo development is something called a **condominium corporation**. But what exactly is a condominium corporation, and how does it work?
 
Whether youâ€™re a board member, an owner, or thinking about self-managing your condo community, this guide will break it down in plain language.

## What Is a Condominium Corporation?
 
A **condominium corporation** is a legal entity thatâ€™s created when a condo development is registered with the provincial land titles office. In Saskatchewan, this is governed by *The Condominium Property Act, 1993*.
 
Once a developer registers the plan, the condo corporation comes into existence â€” itâ€™s responsible for the ownership, governance, and management of the shared property (often called *common property*).
 
> âœ… Think of it like a mini-organization made up of all the unit owners. Every owner automatically becomes a member of the corporation.

## What Does the Corporation Do?
 
The corporation is responsible for managing and maintaining the common property and handling financial and legal matters on behalf of all unit owners. Key responsibilities include:
 
- Maintaining the building and shared spaces (e.g., hallways, roofs, parking)
- Collecting condo fees from unit owners
- Creating and enforcing bylaws
- Managing the reserve fund for major repairs
- Purchasing insurance for the building
- Hiring contractors and service providers
- Preparing financial statements and budgets
 
Many of these tasks are handled by an elected **board of directors**, who act on behalf of all owners.

## How Are Decisions Made?
 
Decisions are made through:
 
- **Board meetings**, where directors vote on operational matters
- **Annual General Meetings (AGMs)**, where owners vote on major decisions
- **Bylaws**, which guide how decisions must be made (e.g., voting thresholds)
 
All owners have voting rights at AGMs and can run for board positions. This structure ensures transparency and collective decision-making.

## What Is Common Property vs. Private Property?
 
In a condominium, each unit owner has two types of interest:
 
1. **Unit ownership** â€“ their individual condo or townhouse  
2. **Common property ownership** â€“ shared ownership in areas like hallways, roofs, landscaping, and elevators
 
The condominium corporation manages the common property on behalf of all owners. Owners typically pay **condo fees** to fund this management.
