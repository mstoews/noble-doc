***Understanding performance versus liquidity in board-level financial oversight***

## Introduction

Board members are often told that an organization “had a surplus” while, in the same meeting, hearing that “cash is tight.”    
This can feel contradictory—but it isn’t.

Understanding the difference between **accrual accounting** and **cash position** is one of the most important financial concepts for effective governance. Boards don’t need to *do* accounting, but they do need to understand how these two perspectives work together to avoid false confidence or unnecessary concern.

## Accrual accounting: measuring true financial performance

Accrual accounting answers a simple but critical question:

**Did the organization earn what it spent during this period?**

Under accrual accounting:

- Revenue is recorded when it is **earned**, not when cash is received
- Expenses are recorded when they are **incurred**, not when they are paid
- Financial results reflect economic reality rather than timing

This is why accrual accounting is used for:

- Financial statements
- Budget comparisons
- Audits
- Long-term planning

For boards, accrual results show whether operations are **financially sustainable** over time.

## Cash: the organization’s ability to operate

Cash answers a different question:

**Can the organization meet its obligations when they come due?**

Cash is about:

- Timing
- Liquidity
- Short-term risk

An organization can:

- Show an accrual surplus but experience cash pressure
- Hold significant cash while running an underlying deficit

Neither situation is unusual—and neither can be understood properly in isolation.

## How both can be true at the same time

### Surplus on paper, cash pressure in practice

- Revenue is earned and recorded (e.g., grants or pledges)
- Cash arrives months later
- Expenses must be paid now

Result:
**Accrual surplus, cash stress**

### Cash available, but structural risk underneath
- Cash received in advance or deferred revenue held
- Operating expenses exceed earned revenue

Result:    
**Healthy cash today, unsustainable performance longer-term**

Boards that look at only one view miss half the picture.

## What board members should focus on

Boards do not need daily cash management or accounting detail. What they *do* need is visibility.

From **accrual financials**, boards should watch:

- Trends in surplus or deficit
- Budget versus actual performance
- Revenue reliability and concentration
- Expense growth relative to mission delivery

From **cash**, boards should understand:

- Current cash position
- Expected timing of inflows and outflows
- Exposure to short-term financing
- Whether timing gaps create risk

The goal is awareness, not micromanagement.

## Common governance mistakes

- Assuming surplus means “everything is fine”
- Ignoring accrual deficits because cash is available
- Treating cash reports as accounting documents
- Reacting to short-term cash noise instead of structural trends
- Expecting finance to “fix” timing issues that require strategic decisions

---

## What good governance looks like

Well-functioning boards:

- Use accrual results to guide strategy
- Use cash information to understand risk
- Ask about timing, not just totals
- Expect clear explanations rather than raw data
- See issues early, not at the point of urgency

When this balance is understood, financial discussions become calmer, clearer, and more productive.

## A simple mental model for board members

If you remember nothing else:

- **Accrual accounting shows performance**
- **Cash shows capacity**
- **Both matter**
- **Neither tells the whole story alone**

---

Understanding this distinction helps boards make better decisions, ask better questions, and support long-term organizational health.
