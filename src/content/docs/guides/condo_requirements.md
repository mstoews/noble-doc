    - **Audit**: Required annually unless 80% of unit owners provide written consent to waive this requirement.

    - **Audit**: Required annually with no option to waive【17:0†source】. 

 

### Steps to Avoid Audits or Reviews 

For condominium corporations that qualify to avoid an audit or review, the following steps should be taken: 

 

1. **Obtain Written Consents**: 

    - **For Corporations with Fewer than 12 Units**: 

        - Obtain written consent from at least 80% of unit owners to waive the annual review. 

    - **For Corporations with 12 to 50 Units**: 

        - Obtain written consent from at least 80% of unit owners to waive the annual audit. 

        - If an audit is waived, obtain written consent from 100% of unit owners to waive the annual review【17:0†source】. 

 

2. **Annual Renewal of Consents**: 

    - Ensure that consents are renewed annually as required by the regulations【17:0†source】. 

 

3. **Notify Non-Consenting Owners**: 

    - Serve notice to any unit owners who did not provide consent, informing them that the financial statements will not be audited or reviewed. Include a description of their right to apply to the court for an order requiring the financial statements to be audited or reviewed【17:0†source】. 

 

4. **Court Applications**: 

    - Be aware that any owner can apply to the court within 30 days of receiving the notice to have the financial statements audited or reviewed. The court may then decide whether to require an audit or review based on fairness and equity【17:0†source】.
