Learn how to invite and interact with team members.

Noble Ledger logs the account activity of team members during the past 180 days. 

To invite new team members:

1. Go to the [Team](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/team) tab in the Dashboard.
1. Click **Add member**.
1. Add one or more email addresses, separated by a space or comma. Adding users together allows you to assign them all the same roles and access simultaneously.
1. Select which roles to assign. Users can hold multiple roles within the same account. Review the [list of actions](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams/roles.md) that each role can and can’t perform before assigning the role to a team member. Grant the lowest permission required by the user to perform their job.
1. After completing the role assignment for all the accounts, review the configuration, and click **Send invites** to email the specified users with the steps to accept the invitation.

Invites to your Noble Ledger account expire after 10 days.

After a team member accepts their invite, you can edit their role at any time from your  settings. To edit a team member’s role, click the overflow menu (⋯), then click **Edit**.

## Mention team members 

You can mention team members when you add a note to a payment. If you mention a team member, they receive an email notification with the note and a link to the associated payment.

## Receive email notifications 

You can configure email notifications under **Communication preferences** in your [Personal details]settings, and apply them on a per-user basis. If your team members also want to receive notifications, they must customize their own settings. Noble Ledger sends email notifications to you when any of the following events occur:
